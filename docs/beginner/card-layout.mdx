In this guide, there will be some images to show off the concepts introduced.

## Play Stacks & Player Hands

- The five **play stacks** are on the left.
- The **player hands** are on the right.
- Alice is always player 1. (She will always go first.)
- Bob is always player 2. (He will always go second.)
- Cards are drawn and added to the left side to each hand.
  - Thus, Alice's newest card is the blue 1 and Bob's newest card is the red 2.
- Conversely, the oldest card is the rightmost card.
  - Thus, Alice's oldest card is the blue 5 and Bob's oldest card is the red 1.
- A card's _slot_ refers to its position in the hand, from left to right.
  - Thus, the blue 1 is on slot 1, the blue 2 is on slot 2, etc.

## Clues

- Arrows indicate that a card was "touched" by the last clue that was given.
- Clued cards will have permanent yellow borders around them. Unclued cards will not have these yellow borders.

<CardLayout2 />

- When a card is "touched" by a clue for the first time, a white arrow will point to the card and a yellow border will be applied.
- When an already-clued card is "retouched" by subsequent clues, a gray arrow will point to the card.
